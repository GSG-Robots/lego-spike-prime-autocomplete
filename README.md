# LEGO Spike Prime python interface for autocompletion

This project is intended for FLL teams using LEGO Spike Prime python interface.

However, the Lego Spike Prime Legacy Software's python editor does not have autocompletion, which is very inconvenient to use.

I found most of the Spike python API here in a single file.
https://github.com/GO-Robot-FLL/Python-for-Spike-Prime/blob/main/FurtherDocumentation.py

I have splitted the above file into appropriate python modules, so that the VSCode auto-completion would work.

## Credits:
* Thanks to [GO-Robot-FLL](https://github.com/GO-Robot-FLL/Python-for-Spike-Prime) for creating an initial 
version of Spike Prime Python API from the Lego documentation, which saved me a lot of typing/copying/pasting.
* Thanks to [Peter Staev](https://github.com/PeterStaev/lego-spikeprime-mindstorms-vscode) for enabling us to use VS Code to program.

## Disclaimer:
* This project is for autocompletion and auto docstring display ONLY, as all the implementations are stubbed out. 
* This project is not a Spike Prime simulator.
* This project uses features of extensions that use unofficial and undocumented APIs. They can change without notice. Functions tested on a LEGO Spike Prime Hub v2.
