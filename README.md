# LEGO Spike Prime python interface for autocompletion

This project is intended for FLL teams using LEGO Spike Prime python interface.

However, the Lego Spike Prime Legacy python program does not have autocompletion.

I found most of the Spike python API is documented here.
https://github.com/GO-Robot-FLL/Python-for-Spike-Prime/blob/main/FurtherDocumentation.py

I have splitted above files into appropriate modules, so that the VSCode autocompletion would work.

Note: this project is for autocompletion and auto docstring display ONLY, as all the implementations are stubbed out. 
THIS PROJECT IS NOT A SPIKE PRIME SIMULATOR.
